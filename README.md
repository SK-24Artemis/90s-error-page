# 90s Error Page
### Created a 90s website inspired error page for my website, complete with a guest book.
Yes, there is both blinking AND scrolling text.

Download as a .zip and open the error.html page in your browser of choice. Or you can go [here to see it in action](http://raenpayne.com/error.html "Spooky 90s themed 404 page").

I was partly inspired by [Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net/). And yes, you should view Cameron's World with the sound up! It's amazing!

# Features
1. Gifs, wow so many gifs. 
2. Blinking and scrolling text. It turns out that modern browsers don't make this easy. I can't understand why, who doesn't love some scrolling text???
3. Animated backgrounds! 
4. Guestbook - yes, you can sign it. Sort of.
Whatever text you add to the guestbook form is stored in localstorage so if you navigate away and come back it looks like it's been saved permanently. But it has not, because that seemed like too much effort. 

# Future Updates - Maybe
### More Mobile Friendly
~~I'd like to edit the page to be a bit more mobile friendly. Currently gifs and large images do not resize to fit smaller screens. ~~
I finally got around to making the error and guestbook pages mobile friendly via some css and media queries. 
### Webring
I created a spooky banner for a webring which currently does not function but I'm thinking about making it work as a fun project to exercise my javascript skills. 
### Javascript
The guestbook works via some somewhat kludgy javascript. I'd like to make it less kludgy as my javascript skills improve. 


**No, I'm not sure why I put so much effort into a page no one will see. :P**
