# 90s-error-page
Created a 90s website inspired error page for my website, complete with a guest book. Yes, there is both blinking and scrolling text. 

Download as a .zip and open the error.html page in your browser of choice. Or you can go [here to see it in action](http://www.raenpayne.com/error "Spooky 90s themed 404 page").



# Features
1. Gifs, wow so many gifs. I was partly inspired by [Cameron's World](https://www.cameronsworld.net/). And yes, you should view Cameron's World with the sound up! It's amazing!
2. Blinking and scrolling text. It turns out that modern browsers don't make this easy. I can't understand why, who doesn't love some scrolling text???
3. Animated backgrounds! 
4. Guestbook - yes, you can sign it. Sort of.
Whatever text you add to the guestbook form is stored in localstorage so if you navigate away and come back it looks like it's been saved permanently. But it has not, because that seemed like too much effort. 

# Future Updates - Maybe
### Webring
I created a spooky banner for a webring which currently does not function but I'm thinking about making a webring. Which I'm sure no one will join - they're kind of useless - but I thought it would be a fun touch. 
### Javascript
The guestbook works via some somewhat kludgy javascript. I'd like to make it less kludgy as my javascript skills improve. 


#### No, I'm not sure why I put so much effort into a page no one will see. :P
